# Design Patterns with Java

This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** using the **Java** programming language. Each design pattern is organized into its respective category to demonstrate the concept and usage effectively.

---

## **Overview**

**Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They help make code more maintainable, reusable, and scalable.

This project includes the following categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns** - Patterns for object creation.
2. **Structural Patterns** - Patterns for organizing classes and objects.
3. **Behavioral Patterns** - Patterns for communication between objects.

## **Patterns Implemented**

### 1. Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method**  
  Location: `creational/factory-method`  
  Description: A pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.  
  Example: `TeaFactory` for creating different types of Tea (GreenTea, LemonTea, MilkTea).

More patterns coming soon...
